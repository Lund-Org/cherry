Cherry is a lightweight framework to quickly generate a web server

## :electric_plug: Installation

Use the package manager [npm](http://npmjs.com) to install Cherry.

```bash
npm install @lund-org/cherry
```

## :wrench: Usage

Checkout the example in the [example folder](https://github.com/Lund-Org/cherry/tree/master/example).

*For the development* : To use the https mode, you need to generate the ssl keys, you can use this command in the config folder :
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=FR/ST=./L=./O=./OU=./CN=."
```
Warning : It doesn't work on Windows, you will only get the key.pem
