[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/9a31be9be174ebcbd59f/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Lund-Org/cherry/maintainability) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/9a31be9be174ebcbd59f/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Lund-Org/cherry/test_coverage)

Cherry is a lightweight framework to quickly generate a web server

## :electric_plug: Installation

Use the package manager [npm](http://npmjs.com) to install Cherry.

```bash
npm install @lund-org/cherry
```

## :wrench: Usage

Checkout the example in the [example folder](https://github.com/Lund-Org/cherry/tree/master/example).

*For the development* : To use the https mode, you need to generate the ssl keys, you can use this command in the config folder :
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=FR/ST=./L=./O=./OU=./CN=."
```
Warning : It doesn't work on Windows, you will only get the key.pem with this command. Let's find the way to do it on stackoverflow :joy:

### Hooks

[Example here](https://github.com/Lund-Org/cherry/tree/master/examples/03-hooks)

You can hook some events and retrieve informations. It is useful to add some code at specific moment of the workflow.

| Hook Name 	| Data sent	|
|------------	|---------	|
| beforeStartServer   | `{ cherry: <Cherry>, server: <CherryHTTPSServer|CherryHTTPServer> }` |
| afterStartServer    | `{ cherry: <Cherry>, server: <CherryHTTPSServer|CherryHTTPServer> }` |
| beforeStopServer    | `{ cherry: <Cherry>, server: <CherryHTTPSServer|CherryHTTPServer> }` |
| afterStopServer     | `{ cherry: <Cherry>, server: <CherryHTTPSServer|CherryHTTPServer> }` |
| beforeStartOrm      | `{ cherry: <Cherry>, orm: <The ORM plugin instance> }` |
| afterStartOrm       | `{ cherry: <Cherry>, orm: <The ORM plugin instance> }` |
| beforeStopOrm       | `{ cherry: <Cherry>, orm: <The ORM plugin instance> }` |
| afterStopOrm        | `{ cherry: <Cherry>, orm: <The ORM plugin instance> }` |
| beforeProcess       | `{ request: <CherryIncomingMessage>, response: <CherryServerResponse>, middlewares: <Array<Function>> }` |
| afterProcess        | `{ request: <CherryIncomingMessage>, response: <CherryServerResponse>, processResult: <The return value of the callback> }` |

### Route types

[Example here](https://github.com/Lund-Org/cherry/tree/master/examples/01-basic) [and here](https://github.com/Lund-Org/cherry/tree/master/examples/04-orm)

There is 2 types of route, the public folders to retrieve raw resources and the configured routes.
:warning: The public routes are always resolved at first

### Public routes

| Route Name 	| Description	|
|------------	|---------	|
| PUBLIC_ROUTE_PUBLIC_FOLDER   | The folder where we will find a resource. It's an entrypoint, it means that if you request a route /my/route.html, if you have it as a configured route and the same path available in your public folder, it will retrieve the file in the public folder and then quit |
